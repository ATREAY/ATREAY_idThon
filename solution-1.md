## Introducing Polygon ID!  

It's an identity infrastructure that promotes self-sovereign identity and privacy by default. It enables secure relationships between apps and users, using verifiable credentials and zero-knowledge proofs.

## Privacy matters!   

With Polygon ID, users can prove their identity without exposing private information. Zero-knowledge proofs ensure both Freedom of Expression and Privacy by Default, securing identities with powerful zero-knowledge cryptography.

## Let's dive into the core concepts of Polygon ID:  

Verifiable Credentials, Identity Holder, Issuer, and Verifierâ€”forming the Triangle of Trust. Unique Decentralized Identifiers and Verifiable Credentials convey diverse information about entities.

## Polygon ID's toolset is fully compliant with W3C standards, ensuring interoperability and seamless integration. 

The framework architecture consists of three modules:  Identity Holder,  Issuer & Verifier,  forming the vital Triangle of Trust.

## Identity Holders securely hold claims, while Issuers generate and cryptographically sign Verifiable Credentials.  

Holders present zero-knowledge proofs to Verifiers for authentication and criteria verification.

## Issuers are entities (people, organizations, or things) that issue Verifiable Credentials to Holders.  

Every VC is signed by the Issuer, ensuring traceability and authenticity. Trust between Verifiers and Issuers is crucial for reliable verification.

## Verifiers are essential in Polygon ID, verifying proofs from Holders. 

They request proofs based on VCs held by the Identity Holder and check criteria like expected Issuer signature and requested information.

## Trust and reputation matter!    

Cryptographically verifying a VC doesn't guarantee its truth. Verifiers rely on trusted Issuers for authentic VCs. A strong Verifier-Issuer relationship ensures reliable identity verification.

## VC verification can occur off-chain or on-chain.  
 
Polygon ID offers flexibility for developers to choose between options. 
On-chain verification using smart contracts enables unique functionalities such as airdrops based on VC criteria.

## Role of Wallet!  

The Wallet, a vital component, enables smooth VC exchange and proof presentation. It securely stores private keys, fetches VCs, generates zero-knowledge proofs, and safeguards identity and sensitive data.

## Privacy and control are key!   

Polygon ID ensures user privacy with zero-knowledge proofs. Users can prove criteria (e.g., age) without disclosing actual information. They control private keys and share data without requiring Issuer permission.

## Polygon ID enables transitive trust across domains. 

Multiple Verifiers can leverage Issuers' information without additional permission. 
Identity Holders build trust by consolidating credentials from different Issuers in a digital wallet.

## (Bonus)ðŸ‘¾:  

Polygon ID is built on the open-source Iden3 protocol, which defines how the system's parties communicate and interact.
